# chutes-ladders
R representation of Chutes and Ladders which statistically analyzes this probabilistic well-known and loved board game.

The simulation was inspired by coursework from **STATS 102A (Introduction to Computational Statistics with R)** and explores:
- Game length distribution
- Chute and ladder usage
- Spatial heat maps of player position over fixed amount of turns

## Files
- `chutes+ladders.Rmd` – main analysis and report
- `cl_helper.R` – helper functions for simulation and plotting
- `chutes+ladders.pdf` – compiled report

## How to run
1. Open `chutes+ladders.Rmd` in RStudio
2. Make sure all files are in the same directory
3. Knit to HTML or PDF
